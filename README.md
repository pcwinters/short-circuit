# short-circuit
Short circuit is a Flux/React strategy for managing data bindings to components. It helps you write *"data driven React applications"* a la Facebook's [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/), but allows you to model any resolution strategy (GraphQL or otherwise). Born from ideas cemented in another library [Adrenaline](https://github.com/gyzerok/adrenaline), short-circuit aims to be extremely flexible, supporting any manner of synchronous or asynchronous API.

> **NOTE** short-circuit is under development, headed towards its first release.

* Tutorial, walkthrough


## Concepts
* `resolve()` - A strategy for resolving data for the queries declared by containers. Typically this will both fetch from your API and manage cache update actions.
* Queries and Args - Containers define their data requirements with respect to:
  * `args(props): Object`) A transformation of props that affect changes in your container's query requirements. Args are optional, because queries can be computed directly from props. But, args will be spread as props along the same lifecycle as the data resolved for queries. In this way, you can be sure that certain props (like id's or filters) that are tightly coupled to queries are updated when the associated data is loaded.
  * `queries(args): Object`) A function that returns a anything that you know how to resolve. An example would be a map of prop/query pairs (the query schema for which should be understood by your resolve function.
* Containers - A container represents a component in your React tree that describes and resolves
data requirements in the form of queries.
  * Root containers - Root containers react to prop/arg changes as well as store changes (via `subscribe`) in order to resolve data for the containers declared queries. Both the resolved data as well as lifecycle information like pending args, failure states, and ready state are made accessible via context. Varying behaviors can be built around the state that root containers expose (loading indicators, failure messages, etc.)

## API

### `<ShortCircuitProvider subscribe [resolve] [createResolve]>`
Short Circuit requires a provider (usually close to the root of your application tree), similar to the [react-redux `<Provider>`](https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#provider-store).
The provider's purpose is to expose an api to containers (_through context_), binding
them to a store updates (redux or otherwise) and a function for resolving data queries.


### `createContainer(options) : Function`
An es7 compatible decorator that will wrap a target component and spread data props from a coupled root container.

#### Example
```
import { createContainer } from 'short-circuit';
@createContainer({
    args: (props) => ({ todoId: props.id })
    query: (args) => ({
        todo: {
            resourceType: 'todo',
            resource: { id: args.todoId }
        }
    }),
    renderPending: false
})
function TodoContainer(props){
    return <div>
        <span>{ props.todoId }: { props.todo.message }</span>
    </div>;
}

function Application(props){
    return (
        <TodoContainer id={props.selectedTodoId} />
    );
}
```

### `createRootContainer(options)`
Root containers are created from specifications of data requirements and maintain and expose state about data fetch. They request data to be resolved using the adapter and store bindings made accessible to them by the Adrenaline Provider, and react to prop changes.

Options can be one of the following:
* `function(props)` - Through which query requirements are computed directly from props.
* `Object` - An object
  * `args(props): Object` - A function returning props that should be treated as args to
  your queries and exposed by containers for gating prop changes along the data resolution lifecycle.
  * `queries(props): Object` - The queries function.
#

### `createDecorator(decoratorFactory)`
*TODO*

#### Example
Advanced example creates a root container that resolves a 'Todo' by id. A custom component receives the state via context and manages a more complex lifecycle for pending load and failure states.
```
import { createRootContainer, rootContainerShape } from 'short-circuit';

const TodoRootContainer = createRootContainer({
    args: (props) => ({ todoId: props.id })
    query: (args) => ({
        todo: {
            resourceType: 'todo',
            resource: { id: args.todoId }
        }
    })
});

function Todo(props, context){
    const shortCircuit = context.shortCircuitRootContainer;
    // Root containers expose their state
    const { current, failed, pending }  = shortCircuit;

    // Implement your own logic for managing ready and error states
    if(failed){
        return <div>Failed to load Todo:{ failed.args.todoId}, {failed.error}</div>
    } else if(!current || current.stale){
        return <div>Loading Todo:{ pending.args.todoId }...</div>;
    } else {
        const { args, data }  = current;
        const { todo }  = data;
        const { todoId } = args;
        return <div>
            <span>{ todoId }: { todo.message }</span>
        </div>;
    }
}

function Application(props){
    return (
        <TodoRootContainer id={props.selectedTodoId} >
            <Todo />
        </TodoRootContainer>
    );
}
```
